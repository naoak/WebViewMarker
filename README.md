WebViewMarker
=============

Text selection support library for Android WebView. The core logic is the same as BTAndroidWebViewSelection.

## What's the difference
- More modular (not inherit webview)
- Not depend quick action lib (for actionbar support)
- Mimic ICS native text selection handler
- Smart tap selection for CJK characters
